# Calorie-Pal
Calorie manager mobile app that tracks daily calories. Gets information from pictures of your full meals. Made at Hack Western.

This application was inspired by Fitness Pal. 
The problem with Fitness Pal is that you spend a lot of time individually entering your food, macros, etc. It takes time out of your day. Why do this when you have an app that does everything for you?

Calorie-Pal (Cal-Pal for short) is an Android app that uses IBM Watson's Visual Recognition API, Nutritionix API, and text to speech aPI.

So a quick run through of this app, you would enter your calculated calories needed for the day, and name. You are then prompted to take a picture of the food, this sends information to the Watson, and tells you what is in the image. With this information, you can send it to Nutritionix to get the nutrition facts, such as calories, vitamins, nutrients, etc. And then you add it to your daily calories. The information is then nicely played to you out loud.

This is targetted for health conscious but busy people. If they are always 'on the go', but also need the time to track their daily calories. I personally would use this app because I am always doing work, coding, school work, researching, etc. I also care about my health, because it is something that a lot of other factors depend on. So, as I don't have the time to use Fitness Pal, I thought to create a better version of it.
